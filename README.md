# okta-dev-terraform

Hello, I really like Okta but I also make a lot of mistakes when managing the work environment that I'm responsible for. Still learning ðŸ¥²

Therefore, I want flex my brain muscles and learn a bit of how other people manage Infrastucture. I want to automate my work and be always tracking my changes.

That includes:
- Reducing blast radii
- Making predictable changes 
- Learning a new skill that brings me more experience.
